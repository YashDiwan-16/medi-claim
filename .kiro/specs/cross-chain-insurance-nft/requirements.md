# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature implements a cross-chain insurance system where users can purchase insurance policies that mint NFTs on Ethereum, and upon claiming insurance, the NFTs are transferred to Polygon. The system provides a decentralized insurance marketplace with blockchain-based policy management and cross-chain asset transfer capabilities.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a user, I want to browse and purchase insurance policies, so that I can protect my assets with blockchain-verified coverage.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user visits the marketplace THEN the system SHALL display available insurance policies with details (coverage amount, premium, duration, terms)
2. WHEN a user selects an insurance policy THEN the system SHALL show policy details and purchase options
3. WHEN a user clicks purchase THEN the system SHALL prompt for payment and policy parameters
4. WHEN payment is confirmed THEN the system SHALL mint a new NFT on Ethereum blockchain representing the insurance policy
5. WHEN the NFT is minted THEN the system SHALL store policy details in the NFT metadata
6. IF the user's wallet is not connected THEN the system SHALL prompt wallet connection before purchase

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a user, I want to view my active insurance policies, so that I can track my coverage and policy details.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user accesses their dashboard THEN the system SHALL display all owned insurance NFTs
2. WHEN a user clicks on a policy NFT THEN the system SHALL show detailed policy information (coverage, expiry, claim status)
3. WHEN a policy is active THEN the system SHALL display remaining coverage period
4. WHEN a policy expires THEN the system SHALL mark it as expired and disable claim functionality

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a user, I want to claim my insurance, so that I can receive compensation for covered incidents.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user initiates a claim THEN the system SHALL verify policy validity and coverage
2. WHEN a claim is submitted THEN the system SHALL require incident documentation and proof
3. WHEN a claim is approved THEN the system SHALL bridge the same insurance NFT from Ethereum to Polygon network
4. WHEN the NFT bridging is completed THEN the system SHALL burn the original NFT on Ethereum and mint the identical NFT on Polygon
5. WHEN the NFT is successfully bridged to Polygon THEN the system SHALL update the claim status to completed
6. IF a policy is already claimed THEN the system SHALL prevent duplicate claims
7. IF a policy is expired THEN the system SHALL reject the claim
8. IF the NFT bridging fails THEN the system SHALL retry the operation and maintain the original NFT on Ethereum

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a user, I want to connect my wallet to both Ethereum and Polygon networks, so that I can interact with the cross-chain insurance system.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user connects their wallet THEN the system SHALL support both Ethereum and Polygon networks
2. WHEN switching networks is required THEN the system SHALL prompt the user to switch networks
3. WHEN transactions are initiated THEN the system SHALL use the appropriate network for the operation
4. IF network switching fails THEN the system SHALL display clear error messages and retry options

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As an administrator, I want to manage insurance policies and claims, so that I can maintain the insurance marketplace.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN creating new insurance products THEN the system SHALL allow setting coverage amounts, premiums, and terms
2. WHEN reviewing claims THEN the system SHALL provide tools to approve or reject claims
3. WHEN managing policies THEN the system SHALL track policy statistics and performance metrics
4. WHEN cross-chain transfers occur THEN the system SHALL log all transactions for audit purposes
